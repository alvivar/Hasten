# BITE Unity WebGL WebSocket Client

**BITE** is a tcp server, but [BITEWS](https://github.com/alvivar/bitews) is a WebSocket proxy for **BITE**.

**BITEBestWS.cs** is a Unity WebGL WebSocket client library for [BITEWS](https://github.com/alvivar/bitews) through the popular Unity Extension [Best HTTP/2](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/network/best-http-2-155981) that you can use in Unity WebGL builds.

By the way, **BITEBestWS.cs** is comment out, just in case you don't have Best HTTP/2 installed.
