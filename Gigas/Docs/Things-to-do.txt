    Things to do

    Cache needs to be optional, like // !gigas !nocache, on by default

    Get cache doesn't work with duplicated components on the same entity

    You can't be sure of RemoveComponent order when there are duplicated
    components on the same entity

    OnEnable / OnDisable pattern friction when the GameObject parent is turned
    off, so OnEnable won't be called again

    OnEnable can't be called after being removed from

    Document the pattern OnEnable / OnDisable to Add / Remove

    Pattern to how to call a particular code on Start, just after starting out,
    OnEnable

    Automatically create a GameObject with all the Systems used on the scene

    debugger: The Prefab system should contain in his name the count of Entities
