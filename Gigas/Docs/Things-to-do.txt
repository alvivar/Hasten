    THINGS TO DO

        Cache needs to be optional, like // !gigas !nocache, on by default

        Get cache doesn't work with duplicated components on the same entity

        You can't be sure of RemoveComponent order when there are duplicated
        components on the same entity

        OnEnable / OnDisable pattern friction when the GameObject parent is turned
        off, so OnEnable won't be called again

        OnEnable can't be called after being removed from

        Document the pattern OnEnable / OnDisable to Add / Remove

        Pattern to how to call a particular code on Start, just after starting out,
        OnEnable

        Automatically create a GameObject with all the Systems used on the scene

        debugger: The Prefab system should contain in his name the count of Entities
