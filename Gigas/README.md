Entity Component System (ECS) for Unity that works over MonoBehaviour tech.

## Motivation

The official Unity ECS (DOTS) is pretty cool and stuff, I tried and I really like what they are creating. But you can't use it yet, and maybe we may need to wait a couple more years for a production-ready well tested version that works completely with everything, who knows.

But I really want to start thinking on Data Oriented patterns for my code and make it easy to eventually migrate to DOTS.

## Goal

- I want to make it easy to port logic and algorithms to DOTS. So, I'll try my best to avoid weird stuff.

- I want this library to be efficient, so, I'll continue looking deeply at the profiler and mutating the code to achieve more power, less garbage. Please look at my code and tell me I can do better, send me a issue with your idea or a pull request.
