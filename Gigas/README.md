Minimalist Entity Component System (ECS) for Unity that works on classic MonoBehaviours.

## Motivation

The official Unity ECS (DOTS) is pretty cool but we can't use it yet, and with some luck maybe we may need to wait until Unity 2024 for a production-ready well tested version that works with everything, who knows.

But the year is 2020, and we want to start thinking with Data Oriented patterns.

## Goal

-   It should be easy to port logic and algorithms to DOTS. So, we'll avoid weird stuff.

-   We want this library to be efficient, so, we'll continue looking deeply at the profiler and mutating the code to achieve more performance.
