###**Hasten**
**Unity GameDev Toolkit**<br /><br />

This is the code base I use in all [my games](http://matnesis.itch.io/). It's
a collection of scripts, extensions, patterns and custom tools for Unity.

Is not as clean or solid as I would like, but I have managed to create all my
stuff with versions of this, and I'm constantly improving it with every new
creation.

Maybe you can find something useful, take a look.
